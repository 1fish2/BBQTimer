App name: BBQ Timer

Application type: Apps

Category: Tools

Content rating: Everyone

Short description: A stopwatch with a lock screen widget and periodic reminders.


Description:

    A stopwatch with a twist (or two):

    1. A lock screen widget lets you access the stopwatch quickly, without unlocking your phone or
       tablet.
    2. Periodic alarms remind you to check the food, however long it takes to cook. It's a
       count-down timer and a count-up stopwatch at the same time.

    Requires few permissions. No network access. No ads. No private data gathering.

    Of course it can time more things than BBQ cooking.

    [Note: The app doesn't install in external storage (SD card) because when you use USB to share
    files with a computer, Android forces external storage apps to exit and deletes their lock/home
    screen widgets.]
