Short description: A stopwatch with a lock screen widget and periodic reminders.


Description:

    A stopwatch with a twist (or two):

    1. A lock screen widget lets you access the stopwatch quickly, without unlocking your phone or
       tablet.
    2. Periodic alarms remind you to check the food, however long it takes to cook. It's a
       count-down timer and a count-up stopwatch at the same time.

    Requires few permissions. No network access. No ads. Gathers no data.

    Of course it can time more things than BBQ cooking.
