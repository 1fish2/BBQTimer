<i>Provides reminder alarms while tracking the total time.</i>

BBQ Timer is a combined interval timer/stopwatch:
1. Quick access via a <b>lock screen notification</b> (no need to unlock your phone) and a home screen widget.
2. <b>Periodic interval alarms</b> remind you to check/turn your food while the app also displays the total elapsed time. (A count-up “stopwatch” won’t alert you and a countdown “timer” won’t track the total time.)
3. <b>Changeable alarms</b> while it’s running.


<b>Tips</b>
• In the app, tap the checkbox to turn the periodic reminder alarms on/off.
  • Type in a periodic alarm interval like these examples: <i>10</i> [10 minutes], <i>7:30</i> [7 minutes, 30 seconds], <i>3:15:00</i> [3 hours, 15 minutes]. <i>12:00</i> can be shortened to <i>12:0</i> or <i>12:</i> or <i>12</i>. <i>0:09</i> can be shortened to <i>:9</i>. <i>2:00:00</i> can be shortened to <i>2:0:0</i> or <i>2::</i> or <i>120</i>. The format is <i>minutes</i>, <i>minutes:seconds</i>, or <i>hours:minutes:seconds</i>.
  • Tap the time display to cycle between <i>stopped</i> → <i>running</i> → <i>paused</i> → <i>stopped</i>.
• Try adding the BBQ Timer widget to the home screen.
  • Tap in the widget to start/pause/stop the timer.
  • Tap the widget's background or its countdown time to open the app.
  • Resize the widget to see more or less info: long-press it then drag its resize handles.
  • To remove the widget, long-press and drag it onto “× Remove”.
• While BBQ Timer is <i>running</i> or <i>paused</i>, it will appear <b>on the lock screen</b> and <b>in the pull-down notification</b> so you can see and control it in those places.
  • To get it on the lock screen, put it in <b>Pause</b> or <b>Play</b> mode by tapping buttons in the app or the home screen widget.
  • You can also long-press the app’s home screen icon, then tap the “Pause at 00:00” shortcut (on Android 7.1+) to make it Paused and ready to go.
• The app, home screen widget, and pull-down notification all show the countdown interval time as well as the total elapsed time (requires Android 7+).
• You can change BBQ Timer’s “Alarm” sound in Settings - Notifications. Don’t pick “None” if you want to hear the interval alarms. To restore the app’s cowbell sound, uninstall and reinstall the app.
