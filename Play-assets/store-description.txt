An interval timer with a twist:
1. Quick access via a <b>lock screen notification</b>. No need to unlock your phone.
2. <b>Periodic alarms</b> to check/turn your food while it continues tracking the total cooking time. (A “stopwatch” won’t alert you while a “timer” won’t track the total time while you turn the fish, check its temperature, and give it more time when needed.)
3. <b>Adjustable alarm interval</b> while it’s running.

Of course it can time more things than cooking.

• Requires minimal app permissions.  
• No network access. No ads. No data gathering.  
• Simple and focused.  
• Free.


<b>Usage Tips</b>
• While BBQ Timer is <i>running</i> or <i>paused</i>, you can operate it <b>from the lock screen</b> or the pull-down notification. To put it on the lock screen when the Timer is <i>stopped</i>, just tap the <b>Pause</b> or <b>Play</b> buttons in the app or the <b>Play</b> button or the timer text in the home screen widget. Another way on Android 7.1 Nougat+ is to use the “Pause at 0:00” app shortcut on the app’s home screen icon.
• Try the home screen widget.
• To stretch out the widget to show longer durations, long-press it then drag its resize handles.
• To remove the widget, long-press and drag it onto “× Remove”.
• Tap the time display to cycle between <i>stopped</i> → <i>running</i> → <i>paused</i> → <i>stopped.</i>
• In the app, tap the checkbox to turn the periodic reminder alarms on/off.

<b>Notification Channel Settings (Android 8.0 Oreo+)</b>
You can use the system Settings to adjust notification sounds. Careful: Some changes will disable the app’s alarm sounds or its lock screen controls. Settings:
• Apps &amp; notifications / notifications / On the lock screen: <b>Show all notification content</b>
• Apps &amp; notifications / App info / BBQ Timer / App notifications: <b>On</b>
• Apps &amp; notifications / App info / BBQ Timer / App notifications / <b>Alarm</b>: <b>On</b>
  • This channel plays the alarm sound and remains to display the timer and the pause/reset/stop controls in the notification area and lock screen.
  • <b>Importance</b> - must be <b>Urgent</b> to enable the “heads up” display from the pull-down notification bar; <b>High</b> or higher to enable alarm sounds; <b>Medium</b> or higher to appear on the lock screen and in the notification area.
  • <b>Sound</b> - you can pick any sound, but don’t pick <b>None</b> if you want to hear the app’s alarms.
  • <b>Vibrate</b> and <b>Blink light</b> - your choice.
  • On the lock screen: <b>Show all notification content</b> to operate the timer from the lock screen.
• Apps &amp; notifications / App info / BBQ Timer / App notifications / <b>Controls</b>: <b>On</b>
  • This channel displays the timer and the pause/reset/stop controls in the notification area and lock screen when the app doesn’t need to play the alarm sound.
  • <b>Importance</b>: must be <b>Medium</b> or higher to appear on the lock screen and in the notification area.
  • On the lock screen: <b>Show all notification content</b> to operate the timer from the lock screen.

The system alarm volume adjusts the app’s alarm volume. If you turn it all the way down, the app can’t sound audible alarms. It can still vibrate and blink the notification LED, if enabled.
