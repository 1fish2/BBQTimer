A timer with a twist (or two):
(1) <b>Lock screen operation</b> for quick access via a <em>lock screen notifications</em> (Android 5.0+ Lollipop+) or <em>lock screen widgets</em> (Android 4.2 Jelly Bean to 4.4 KitKat).
(2) <b>Periodic alarms</b> remind you to check/turn the food while it counts up the total cooking time.

Of course it can time more things than cooking.

• Requires no special permissions.  
• No network access. No ads. No data gathering.

<b>Notification Channel Settings (Android 8.0+)</b>
In Android 8.0 (Oreo), you can use the system Settings to adjust notification sounds. Be careful: Some changes will disable the app's periodic alarm sounds or its lock screen features. Key settings:
• Apps &amp; notifications / notifications / On the lock screen: <b>Show all notification content</b>
• Apps &amp; notifications / App info / BBQ Timer / App notifications: <b>On</b>
• Apps &amp; notifications / App info / BBQ Timer / App notifications / <b>Alarm</b>: <b>On</b>
  •• This notification channel is used to play the alarm sound, and it remains to display the timer and the pause/reset/stop controls in the notification area and on the lock screen.
  •• <b>Importance</b>: must be <b>Urgent</b> to enable the “heads up” display from the pull-down notification bar; <b>High</b> or higher to enable alarm sounds; <b>Medium</b> or higher to appear on the lock screen and in the notification area.
  •• <b>Sound</b> - you can pick any sound, but don't pick <b>None</b> if you want to hear the app’s alarms.

The system alarm volume controls the volume of the app’s alarms. If you turn it all the way down,
the app won’t sound audible alarms. It can still vibrate and blink the notification LED, if enabled.
