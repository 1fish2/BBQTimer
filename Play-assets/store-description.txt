<i>Provides reminder alarms while tracking the total time.</i>

BBQ Timer is a combined interval timer/stopwatch:
1. Quick access via a <b>lock screen notification</b> (no need to unlock your phone) and a home screen widget.
2. <b>Periodic alarms</b> to check/turn your food while it also tracks the total time. (A count-up “stopwatch app” won’t alert you and a countdown “timer app” won’t track the total time as you turn the food and check its temperature.) BBQ Timer displays the reminder alarm timer and the total time.
3. <b>Adjustable reminder alarm period</b> while it’s running.

Of course it can time more things than cooking, like interval exercises.

• Requires minimal app permissions.  
• No network access. No ads. No data collection.  
• Simple and focused.  
• Free.


<b>Tips</b>
