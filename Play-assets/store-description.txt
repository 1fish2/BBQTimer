An interval timer with a twist:
1. Quick access via a <b>lock screen notification</b>. No need to unlock your phone.
2. <b>Periodic alarms</b> to check/turn your food while it continues tracking the total cooking time. (A “stopwatch” won’t alert you while a “timer” won’t track the total time while you turn the fish, check its temperature, and give it more time when needed.)
3. <b>Adjustable alarm interval</b> while it’s running.

Of course it can time more things than cooking.

• Requires minimal app permissions.  
• No network access. No ads. No data gathering.  
• Simple and focused.  
• Free.


<b>Usage Tips</b>
• While BBQ Timer is <i>running</i> or <i>paused</i>, you can operate it <b>from the lock screen</b> or the pull-down notification. To put it on the lock screen when the Timer is <i>stopped</i>, tap the <b>Pause</b> or <b>Play</b> buttons in the app or the <b>Play</b> button or the timer text in the home screen widget. Another way on Android 7.1 Nougat+ is to use the “Pause at 0:00” app shortcut on the app’s home screen icon.
• Try the home screen widget.
• To stretch out the widget to show longer durations, long-press it then drag its resize handles.
• To remove the widget, long-press and drag it onto “× Remove”.
• Tap the time display to cycle between <i>stopped</i> → <i>running</i> → <i>paused</i> → <i>stopped.</i>
• In the app, tap the checkbox to turn the periodic reminder alarms on/off.

<b>Beware: These System Settings interfere with BBQTimer notifications and alarms:</b>
• System - “Alarm volume” inaudibly low.
• Lock screen - “Don’t show notifications at all”.
• Lock screen - “Hide silent conversations and notifications” or “Don’t show any notifications”.
• BBQTimer “Alarm” notification - off, or “Silent”, or sound “None”, or Importance “Medium” or “Low”.
• BBQTimer “Controls” notification - off, or “Minimize” to one line, or Importance “Low”.

You can set BBQTimer’s “Alarm” sound in the system Notification controls. To change back, uninstall and reinstall the app.
