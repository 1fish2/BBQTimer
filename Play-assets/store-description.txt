A combination interval timer/stopwatch with a twist:
1. Quick access via a <b>lock screen notification</b>. No need to unlock your phone.
2. <b>Periodic alarms</b> to check/flip your food while it continues tracking the total cooking time. (A “stopwatch” won’t alert you while a “timer” won’t track the total time while you flip the food, check its temperature, and give it more time as needed.)
3. <b>Adjustable alarm interval</b> while it’s running.

Of course it can time more things than cooking.

• Requires minimal app permissions.  
• No network access. No ads. No data collection.  
• Simple and focused.  
• Free.


<b>Usage Tips</b>
• While BBQ Timer is <i>running</i> or <i>paused</i>, you can operate it <b>from the lock screen</b> or the pull-down notification. To put it on the lock screen when the Timer is <i>stopped</i>, tap the <b>Pause</b> or <b>Play</b> buttons in the app or the <b>Play</b> button or the timer text in the home screen widget. Another way on Android 7.1 Nougat+ is to use the “Pause at 0:00” app shortcut on the app’s home screen icon.
• Try the home screen widget.
• To stretch out the widget to show longer durations, long-press it then drag its resize handles.
• To remove the widget, long-press and drag it onto “× Remove”.
• Tap the time display to cycle between <i>stopped</i> → <i>running</i> → <i>paused</i> → <i>stopped.</i>
• In the app, tap the checkbox to turn the periodic reminder alarms on/off.

<b>Note: System Settings needed to enable BBQTimer notifications and alarms</b>
• “Alarm volume” at an audible level.
• Lock screen - “Show all notifications”. [or non-private ones?]
• BBQTimer notifications enabled, not Silent. (You can also choose to “Override Do Not Disturb“.)
• BBQTimer “Alarm” notification channel - enabled, not “Silent”, not sound choice “None”, Importance “High” or higher to be audible (“Medium” or higher to appear on the lock screen and in the notification area). "Pop on screen" is also useful.

You can set BBQTimer’s “Alarm” sound in the system Notification controls. To change back, uninstall and reinstall the app.
