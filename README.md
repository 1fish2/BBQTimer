The BBQTimer Android app is a stopwatch with a twist, actually two:
* It has a lock screen widget so you can check the timer without unlocking your phone.
* [TODO] It can set alarm times, like a count-down timer while still counting up the time that the food has been cooking.

Status: In development. Not ready for alpha test or use.
