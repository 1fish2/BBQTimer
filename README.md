# BBQTimer Android app

It's a stopwatch with a twist or two:
1. It has a lock screen widget so you can check the timer without unlocking your phone.
2. [TODO] It can set alarm times (like a count-down timer) while still counting up the time that the food has been cooking, however long that takes.

## Status
In development. Not ready for alpha test.

## Build
Using Android Studio.

## TODO
* Add Start/Stop and Reset buttons to the widget.
* Make the widget prettier: add an icon or image buttons; margins, background, translucent widget background frame.
* Show the date and time in the widget. (Only on the lock screen? Vertically resizable?)
* Change the widget display when stopped at 0:00, e.g. just show the date, time, and start button.
* Add a widget preview image.
* Set other AndroidManifest.xml values. (Search info?)
* App icons.
* Use image buttons for Start/Stop & Reset.
* Add the alarm feature -- on the main activity? Use, replace, or remove the Settings menu.
* Display a notification for the alarms so people can tell why it beeped.
* Implement app thumbnail.
* Provide color feedback when tapping on the time display text view, like the system stopwatch app.
* Follow system theme colors?
