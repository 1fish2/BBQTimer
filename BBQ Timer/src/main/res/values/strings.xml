    <!-- Label for the button that pauses the running timer. This stops the timer without resetting
      the timer, and the timer can be resumed after this, so "pause" is a more fitting term than
      "stop" in English. -->

    <!-- The initial text for a reset timer showing 0 minutes and 0.0 seconds. This should match the
      locale's format used by the Android OS utility DateUtils.formatElapsedTime() with appended
      tenths of a second, BUT it doesn't really matter since it gets replaced immediately with a
      string computed by formatting the timer duration value 0. See time_format.

      The Android OS standard format is "00:00" in English even though "0:00" would look better. -->
    <string name="time0">00:00.0</string>

    <!-- The format string for assembling and HTML-styling a timer duration.

      "%1$s" is a placeholder for the already-localized "00:00" part that came from
      DateUtils.formatElapsedTime().

      "%2$s" is a placeholder for the already-localized fraction part ".0". It's wrapped in
      "<small>" HTML markup to make it less distracting on the activity's display and to make it fit
      better on the screen. This way, "12:34:56.7" fits on a Galaxy Nexus screen.

      The "<![CDATA[ ... ]]>" wrapper quotes the HTML markup so it can be in strings.xml
      and get through to the application code at run time.

      In localization, this can put the entire "<small><small>%2$s</small></small>" part before the
      "%1$s". Do RTL locales need to do that??? -->
