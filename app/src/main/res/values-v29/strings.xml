    <!-- The settings needed for the app's Alarm notification channel to work.
     This should match the strings in the Android Settings UI:
     "Show notifications", not "Silent", and "Pop on screen".
     [On Android 10, Settings uses the term "Alerting" but on Android 11 - 12 it
     uses the term "Silent".]
     On Android 11 - 12, space is very tight for this string: one line of
     ≈53 characters on Pixel 3; ≈32 characters on a WQVGA screen, so put the
     essential instructions in the first part of the text and squeeze.
     "&amp;" counts as one character. -->
    <string name="notification_alarm_channel_description">Must Show, be non-Silent &amp; Pop on screen to hear/see alarms</string>
